+-------------------------------+--------------------------------+

# Background

We interact with computers in many different ways, such as through a
keyboard and mouse, and touch screen interfaces. The most widely used
way to interact with personal computers is called a **graphical user
interface** (GUI). With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse
and using menu-driven interactions.

While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to use, this way of
delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly. Imagine the
following task: you have to copy the third line of one thousand text
files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single
file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for
several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the
process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take
advantage of the Unix shell. **The Unix shell is both a command-line
interface (CLI) and a scripting language**, allowing such repetitive
tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the
shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times
as we want. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be
accomplished in seconds.

# The Shell

The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell,
it's possible to invoke complicated programs or simple commands with
only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne
Again SHell --- so-called because it's derived from a shell written by
Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most implementations of
Unix (Mac computers running macOS Catalina or later releases, the
default Unix Shell is "Zsh") and in most packages that provide Unix-like
tools for Windows. Note that 'Git Bash' is a piece of software that
enables Windows users to use a Bash-like interface when interacting with
Git.

Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a
GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not
automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like
new vocabulary in a language you're studying. Luckily, a small number of
"words" (i.e. commands) gets you a long way, and we'll cover those
essential few today.

The grammar of a shell allows you to combine existing tools into
powerful pipelines and handle large volumes of data automatically.
Sequences of commands can be written into a *script*, improving the
reproducibility of workflows.

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with
remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near
essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including
high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing
systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to
interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on
the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of
scientific questions and computational challenges.

Let's get started.

## The prompt

When the shell is first opened, you are presented with a **prompt**,
indicating that the shell is waiting for input.

``` bash
$
```

The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but may use a different
symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we'll show the prompt as `$`.
Most importantly, *do not type the prompt* when typing commands. Only
type the command that follows the prompt. This rule applies both in
these lessons and in lessons from other sources. Also note that after
you type a command, you have to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to
execute it.

The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates
the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a
flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You
may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.

Note that your prompt might look a little different. In particular, most
popular shell environments by default put your user name and the host
name before the `$`. Such a prompt might look like, e.g.:

``` bash
sklucas@localhost $
```

The prompt might even include more than this. Do not worry if your
prompt is not just a short `$`. This lesson does not depend on this
additional information and it should also not get in your way. The only
important item to focus on is the `$` character itself and we will see
later why.

::: {.callout appearance="simple"}
### OPTIONAL: Change your prompt to `$`

If you'd like to simplify your prompt for the purposes of this tutorial,
copy and paste the code below into your terminal:

``` bash
PS1='$ '
```
:::

So let's try our first command, `ls`, which is short for **listing**.
This command will list the contents of the current directory:

``` bash
$ ls
```

``` output
Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures
Documents   Library     Music       Public
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
# Command not found

If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed,
it will print an error message such as:

``` bash
$ ks
```

``` output
ks: command not found
```

This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program
corresponding to that command is not installed.

# Key Points

-   A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and
    run other programs.
-   This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of
    Unix.
-   Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line
    prompt.
-   The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
    its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to
    access networked machines.
-   A significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what
    commands need to be run and how to run them.

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and
directories is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into
files, which hold information, and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and
delete files and directories. To start exploring them, we'll go to our
open shell window.

## Where am I?

First, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like
*places* — at any time while we are using the shell, we are in exactly
one place called our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read
and write files in the current working directory, i.e. 'here', so
knowing where you are before running a command is important. `pwd` shows
you where you are:

``` bash
$ pwd
```

``` bash
/Users/sklucas
```

The computer's response is `/Users/sklucas`, which is my **home
directory**.

### The home directory

The home directory will look different on different operating systems.

-   Linux: `/home/sklucas`
-   Windows: `C:\Users\sklucas` (This may differ based on Windows
    versions)

If `pwd` returns something else, you may need to navigate to your home
directory using the command `cd`.

Let's look at how a filesystem is organized:

![](fig/filesystem_yellow.png){fig-alt="The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories titled bin, data, users, and tmp"
width="400"}

The filesystem looks like an upside-down tree. We refer to the topmost
directory as the "root directory". It contains everything else. It is
referred to with the `/` symbol.

In this illustration, we have several other directories stemming off of
the root. The `bin` directory often refers to a location where programs
are stored. `tmp` is a common directory on filesystems as a place to
hold files that don't need to be kept long-term. You may recognize the
`Users` directory from the output we had above when typing `pwd`. We
know the path of our **home directory**, where we currently are, is
`/Users/sklucas`.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Slashes

There are two meanings for the `/` character. When it appears at the
front of a path, it means "root", when it appears within a path, it acts
as a separator.
:::

![](fig/filesystem_users.png){width="400"}

The `Users` folder may have more than one directory in it. For example,
the image below depicts two users, sklucas and Collin. The home
directory just as the home directory for sklucas is `/Users/sklucas`,
the home directory for Collin would be `/Users/Collin`. **Typically,
when you open a new command prompt, you will start in your home
directory by default**

## Listing directory contents

We often want to know what a directory contains. To do this, we use the
"listing" command `ls`:

``` bash
$ ls
```

which might return something that looks like this (results will vary):

``` bash
Applications  Documents  Library  Music    Public
Desktop       Downloads  Movies   Pictures  
```

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in your current
location. Typing `ls -F` will give specific notation below based on the

-   A trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory

-   `@` indicates a link

-   `*` indicates an executable

Depending on your shell's default settings, the shell might also use
colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Clearing your terminal

If your screen gets too cluttered, you can clear your terminal using the
`clear` command. You can still access previous commands using
{{< kbd ↑ >}} and {{< kbd ↓ >}} to move line-by-line, or by scrolling in
your terminal.
:::

## Getting help

Most bash commands have help menus that tell the user about how the
command is used and what **options** are available for tailoring the
function. There are two common ways to get help with commands, which can
differ based on the source of the command (built-in or externally
installed), and the operating system.

1.  We can pass a `--help` option to any command (on linux and Git
    Bash).

    ``` bash
    $ ls --help
    ```

2.  We can read the manual on a function using the `man` command (linux
    and OSX)

    ``` bash
    $ man ls
    ```

    To navigate through the `man` pages, you may use {{< kbd ↑ >}} and
    {{< kbd ↓ >}} to move line-by-line, or try {{< kbd b >}} and
    {{< kbd Spacebar >}} to skip up and down by a full page. To search
    for a character or word in the `man` pages, use {{< kbd / >}}
    followed by the character or word you are searching for. Sometimes a
    search will result in multiple hits. If so, you can move between
    hits using {{< kbd N >}} (for moving forward) and
    {{< kbd Shift+N >}} (for moving backward). To \*\*quit\*\* the `man`
    pages, press {{< kbd q >}}.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Bash Built-in commands

Some commands are built in to the Bash shell, rather than existing as
separate programs on the filesystem. One example is the `cd` "change
directory" command. If you get a message like `No manual entry for cd`,
try `help cd` instead. The `help` command is how you get usage
information for [Bash
built-ins](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html).
:::

## Command options

We've seen that commands can have many options associated with them,
which can control how the command functions. These are often notated by
short and long forms that are typically equal in their meaning, but have
conventional use in different scenarios.

When options exist as both short and long options:

-   Use the short option when typing commands directly into the shell to
    minimize keystrokes and get your task done faster.

-   Use the long option in scripts to provide clarity. It will be read
    many times and typed once.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Unsupported commandline options

If you try to use an option that is not supported, `ls` and other
commands will usually print an error message similar to:

``` bash
$ ls -j
```

Mac zsh output:

``` bash
ls: invalid option -- j
usage: ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWXabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]
```

other Unix output:

``` bash
ls: invalid option -- 'j'
Try 'ls --help' for more information.
```
:::

### Challenge Questions

Explore the `ls` command options to answer the following questions:

:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 1: Listing in long, human-readable format

Which options for `ls` produces output in *long* format that is *human
readable*? (i.e. displaying something like `5.3K` instead of `5369)`

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

the options `-l` and `-h` can be used with `ls` to make the output long
and human readable. You can use them in two ways:

-   `ls -l -h`

-   or string them together `ls -lh`
:::
::::

:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 2: Listing in Reverse Chronological Order

By default, `ls` lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order
by name. The command `ls -t` lists items by time of last change instead
of alphabetically. The command `ls -r` lists the contents of a directory
in reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the `-t`
and `-r` options? Hint: You may need to use the `-l` option to see the
last changed dates.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

The most recently changed file is listed last when using `-rt`. This can
be very useful for finding your most recent edits or checking to see if
a new output file was written.
:::
::::

## Exploring other directories

Not only can we use `ls` on the current working directory, but we can
use it to list the contents of a different directory. Let's take a look
at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`, i.e., the command
`ls` with the `-F` **option** and the **argument** `Desktop`. The
argument `Desktop` tells `ls` that we want a listing of something other
than our current working directory:

``` bash
$ ls -F Desktop
```

You should see your newly created directory "workshop"

``` bash
shell-lesson-data/
```

Note that if a directory named `Desktop` does not exist in your current
working directory, this command will return an error. Typically, a
`Desktop` directory exists in your home directory, which we assume is
the current working directory of your bash shell.

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in
your Desktop directory, including the `shell-lesson-data` directory you
downloaded at the setup for this lesson. (On most systems, the contents
of the `Desktop` directory in the shell will show up as icons in a
graphical user interface behind all the open windows. See if this is the
case for you.)

Organizing things hierarchically helps us keep track of our work. While
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory just as
it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, it's much
easier to find things when they've been organized into sensibly-named
subdirectories.

Now that we know the `shell-lesson-data` directory is located in our
Desktop directory, we can do two things.

First, using the same strategy as before, we can look at its contents by
passing a directory name to `ls`:

``` bash
$ ls -F Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

``` bash
exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/
```

Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
we are no longer located in our home directory.

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to
change our working directory. `cd` stands for 'change directory', which
is a bit misleading. The command doesn't change the directory; it
changes the shell's current working directory. In other words it changes
the shell's settings for what directory we are in. The `cd` command is
akin to double-clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into
that folder.

Let's say we want to move into the `exercise-data` directory we saw
above. We can use the following series of commands to get there:

``` bash
$ cd Desktop
$ cd shell-lesson-data
$ cd exercise-data
```

These commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop
directory, then into the `shell-lesson-data` directory, then into the
`exercise-data` directory. You will notice that `cd` doesn't print
anything. This is normal. Many shell commands will not output anything
to the screen when successfully executed. But if we run `pwd` after it,
we can see that we are now in
`/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data`.

If we run `ls -F` without arguments now, it lists the contents of
`/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data`, because that's
where we now are:

``` bash
$ pwd
```

``` bash
/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
```

``` bash
$ ls -F
```

``` bash
alkanes/  animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt  writing/
```

We now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a
subdirectory), but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and
go into its parent directory)? We might try the following:

``` bash
$ cd shell-lesson-data
```

``` bash
-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory
```

But we get an error! Why is this?

With our methods so far, `cd` can only see sub-directories inside your
current directory. There are different ways to see directories above
your current location; we'll start with the simplest.

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level. It
works as follows:

``` bash
$ cd ..
```

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this
one", or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory. Sure
enough, if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in
`/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data`:

``` bash
$ pwd
```

``` bash
/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`. If
we want to display it, we can add the `-a` option to `ls -F`:

``` bash
$ ls -F -a
```

``` bash
./  ../  exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/
```

`-a` stands for 'show all' (including hidden files); it forces `ls` to
show us file and directory names that begin with `.`, such as `..`
(which, if we're in `/Users/sklucas`, refers to the `/Users` directory).
As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just
called `.`, which means 'the current working directory'. It may seem
redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined
with a single `-` and no spaces between the options; `ls -F -a` is
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Other Hidden Files

In addition to the hidden directories `..` and `.`, you may also see a
file called `.bash_profile`. This file usually contains shell
configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories
beginning with `.`. These are usually files and directories that are
used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix `.` is
used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal
when a standard `ls` command is used.
:::

These three commands are the basic commands for navigating the
filesystem on your computer: `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`. Let's explore some
variations on those commands. What happens if you type `cd` on its own,
without giving a directory?

``` bash
$ cd
```

How can you check what happened? `pwd` gives us the answer!

``` bash
$ pwd
```

``` bash
/Users/sklucas
```

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home
directory, which is great if you've got lost in your own filesystem.

Let's try returning to the `exercise-data` directory from before. Last
time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the
list of directories to move to `exercise-data` in one step:

``` bash
$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
```

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`.

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use
`cd ..`. But there is another way to move to any directory, regardless
of your current location.

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as
above), we have been using **relative paths**. When you use a relative
path with a command like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location
from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory
by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated
by a leading slash. The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the
path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly
one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `shell-lesson-data` directory from
anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside `exercise-data`). To
find the absolute path we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then
extract the piece we need to move to `shell-lesson-data`.

``` bash
$ pwd
```

``` bash
/Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data
```

``` bash
$ cd /Users/sklucas/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
```

Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple" icon="false"}
### Two more shortcuts

The shell interprets a tilde (`~`) character at the start of a path to
mean "the current user's home directory". For example, if your home
directory is `/Users/sklucas`, then `~/data` is equivalent to
`/Users/sklucas/data`. This only works if it is the first character in
the path; `here/there/~/elsewhere` is *not*
`here/there/Users/sklucas/elsewhere`.

Another shortcut is the `-` (dash) character. `cd` will translate `-`
into *the previous directory I was in*, which is faster than having to
remember, then type, the full path. This is a *very* efficient way of
moving *back and forth between two directories* -- i.e. if you execute
`cd -` twice, you end up back in the starting directory.

The difference between `cd ..` and `cd -` is that the former brings you
*up*, while the latter brings you *back*.

### Challenge Questions

:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 3: Absolute vs Relative Paths

Starting from `/Users/sklucas/data`, which of the following commands
could sklucas use to navigate to her home directory, which is
`/Users/sklucas`?

1.  `cd .`
2.  `cd /`
3.  `cd /home/sklucas`
4.  `cd ../..`
5.  `cd ~`
6.  `cd home`
7.  `cd ~/data/..`
8.  `cd`
9.  `cd ..`

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}

1.  No: `.` stands for the current directory.
2.  No: `/` stands for the root directory.
3.  No: sklucas's home directory is `/Users/sklucas`.
4.  No: this command goes up two levels, i.e. ends in `/Users`.
5.  Yes: `~` stands for the user's home directory, in this case
    `/Users/sklucas`.
6.  No: this command would navigate into a directory `home` in the
    current directory if it exists.
7.  Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
8.  Yes: shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.
9.  Yes: goes up one level.

1.  `../backup: No such file or directory`
2.  `2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27`
3.  `2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/`
4.  `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}

1.  No: there *is* a directory `backup` in `/Users`.
2.  No: this is the content of `Users/thing/backup`, but with `..`, we
    asked for one level further up.
3.  No: see previous explanation.
4.  Yes: `../backup/` refers to `/Users/backup/`.

#### Question 4: `ls` reading comprehension

Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`,
and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order, what command(s)
will result in the following output:

``` bash
pnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/
```

![](fig/challenge_question3.png){width="500"}

1.  `ls pwd`
2.  `ls -r -F`
3.  `ls -r -F /Users/backup`

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

1.  No: `pwd` is not the name of a directory.
2.  Yes: `ls` without directory argument lists files and directories in
    the current directory.
3.  Yes: uses the absolute path explicitly.

## General Syntax of a Shell Command

We have now encountered commands, options, and arguments, but it is
perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.

Consider the command below as a general example of a command, which we
will dissect into its component parts:

``` bash
$ ls -F /
```

![](fig/command_syntax.png)

`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-F` and an **argument**
`/`. We've already encountered options which either start with a single
dash (`-`), known as **short options**, or two dashes (`--`), known as
**long options**. **Options** change the behavior of a command and
**arguments** tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and
directories). Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as
**parameters**. A command can be called with more than one option and
more than one argument, but a command doesn't always require an argument
or an option.

You might sometimes see options being referred to as **switches** or
**flags**, especially for options that take no argument. In this lesson
we will stick with using the term *option*.

Each part is separated by spaces. If you omit the space between `ls` and
`-F` the shell will look for a command called `ls-F`, which doesn't
exist. Also, capitalization can be important. For example, `ls -s` will
display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while
`ls -S` will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:

``` bash
$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
$ ls -s exercise-data
```

``` bash
total 28
 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 alkanes   4 writing
```

Note that the sizes returned by `ls -s` are in *blocks*. As these are
defined differently for different operating systems, you may not obtain
the same figures as in the example.

``` bash
$ ls -S exercise-data
```

``` bash
animal-counts  creatures  alkanes  writing  numbers.txt
```

Putting all that together, our command `ls -F /` above gives us a
listing of files and directories in the root directory `/`. An example
of the output you might get from the above command is given below:

``` bash
$ ls -F /
```

``` bash
Applications/         System/
Library/              Users/
Network/              Volumes/
```

> ## Your Task: Organizing Files

> You create a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` (to remind yourself
> where the data came from), which will contain the data files from the
> assay machine and your data processing scripts.
>
> Each of your physical samples is labelled according to your lab's
> convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as 'NENE01729A'. This
> ID is what you used in your collection log to record the location,
> time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so you decide to
> use it within the filename of each data file. Since the output of the
> assay machine is plain text, you will call your files
> `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on. All 1520 files will go
> into the same directory.
>
> Now in your current directory `shell-lesson-data`, you can see what
> files you have using the command:
>
> ``` bash
> $ ls north-pacific-gyre/
> ```
>
> This command is a lot to type, but you can let the shell do most of
> the work through what is called **tab completion**. If you types:

> ``` bash
> $ ls nor

>
> and then presses Tab (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell
> automatically completes the directory name for you:
>
> ``` bash
> $ ls north-pacific-gyre/
> ```
>
> Pressing Tab again does nothing, since there are multiple
> possibilities; pressing Tab twice brings up a list of all the files.
>
> If you then presses G and then presses Tab again, the shell will
> append 'goo' since all files that start with 'g' share the first three
> characters 'goo'.
>
> ``` bash
> $ ls north-pacific-gyre/goo
> ```
>
> To see all of those files, you can press Tab twice more.
>
> ``` bash
> ls north-pacific-gyre/goo
> goodiff.sh   goostats.sh
> ```
>
> This is called **tab completion**, and we will see it in many other
> tools as we go on.

##  Key Points

-   The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories
    (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which then form a
    directory tree.
-   `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
-   `ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls`
    on its own lists the current working directory.
-   `cd [path]` changes the current working directory.
-   Most commands take options that begin with a single `-`.
-   Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\` on
    Windows.
-   `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
-   An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file
    system.
-   A relative path specifies a location starting from the current
    location.
-   `.` on its own means 'the current directory'; `..` means 'the
    directory above the current one'.
